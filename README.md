# NATBreaker
IPtable scripts for forwarding traffic through a tunnel interface.

After initializing VPN (Using Openvpn), these scripts have a server and a client version that will forward and transmit packet inside a NAT if a user does not have an external IPv4 address.  Requires a VPS of some sort with a dedicated IPv4 address.
